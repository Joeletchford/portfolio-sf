This publication and web experience explores what it means to choose to disconnect from a digital presence in today’s post-digital environment. I question whether the possibility of experiencing a sense of connection or transcendence is directly correlated with disconnecting from an online presence.

Human connections are no longer limited to face-to-face encounters, mouth to ear, or the subtleties of our shifting limbs. The digital world fosters new and different communication as it continues to expand our interactions daily—constant, ever-present, threading itself through the most intimate moments we experience. We use these digital frameworks of interaction for the same purposes as physical interaction, because this realm is real. No longer a secondary virtual existence, the web is now a cultural and existential norm. From this viewpoint, I explore the notion of disconnection in relation to ubiquitous digital culture and presence. This work focuses on the conscious decision to disconnect working towards informing a future reconnection with combined cultural and societal existence. Technology’s fluidity, complementary to our existence, facilitates a personal self-awareness — or presence — but, paradoxically, disconnecting oneself from these connective tools facilitates the feelings of connection and presence in nature.

The main body of work created in parallel with the written thesis publication. This web interaction is my illustration of the Atmospheric Disconnection. Within this interaction I am pushing to create a piece that implements both an appreciation and observance, as well as an active element of participation. The web is activated by one individual whose touch directly effects the film. These interactions are insights into our technologies' presence, best illustrated as the atmosphere. The interactions represents how we reach moments of un-knowing in such a ubiquitous digital existence.
